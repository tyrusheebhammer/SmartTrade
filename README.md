# SmartTrade
My Intention is to get experience developing python software that interfaces with a web socket to receive daily financial information. I will use technical indicators to filter information coming. Will also attempt to make this extensible to deep learning input. Going to attempt to use design principles learned in the design principles class I am taking currently.
